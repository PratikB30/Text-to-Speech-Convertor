# Text-to-Speech Converter

This web application allows users to upload various document formats (images, Word documents, PDFs) and get them converted into downloadable audio files.

## Functionality Overview
The application leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to extract text from uploaded files. This extracted text is then processed by a text-to-speech engine, which converts it into an audio format (typically MP3). Users can then download the generated audio file for playback.

## Key Technologies:

- Flask: Provides the web application framework.
- Tesseract: Enables Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction.
- Text-to-Speech Engine (gTTS or pyttsx3): Converts extracted text to speech.

---
  
### How It Works
- Users visit the web interface and upload a document file.
- The application utilizes OCR to extract text from the uploaded file, handling various formats like images (PNG, JPG, JPEG), Word documents (DOCX, DOC), and PDFs.
- The extracted text is fed into a text-to-speech engine, which synthesizes the text into an audio file.
- Users are presented with the option to download the generated audio file.

### Benefits:

- Accessibility: Converts documents into a format suitable for audio listeners.
- Convenience: Simplifies the process of consuming text content through audio.
- Versatility: Supports different document formats for user flexibility.
